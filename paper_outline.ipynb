        "Aside from Quarterbacks (QB), elite pass rushers–Defensive Ends (DE), Outside Linebackers (OLB), or, simply, Edge Rushers (EDGE)--are arguably the most coveted talents in the NFL. In fact, in each of the last 9 NFL Drafts, the #1 overall pick has either been a QB (6) or a DE (3). If we instead consider the top 2 overall picks during the same timespan, the breakdown is QB (10) DE (6), LT (1), and RB (1)$.^2$ Simply put, NFL teams place a large amount of stock in finding and evaluating pass rush talent.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this project, we introduce an analytical framework, which we coin *Recurrent Pressure Probabilities (RePP)* that we hope can provide more depth to the often-cited count statistics *Sacks (SK)*, *QB Knockdowns (QBKD)*, *QB Hurries (HRRY)*, or when considered jointly, Pressures (PRSS). Specifically, we aim to provide two novel contributions through our approach:\n",

To illustrate the power of leveraging the sequences, we compare the LSTM approach to a “naive” logistic regression model that did not account for temporal relations in the data.\n",

        "Using the player tracking data, Pro Football Focus scouting data, and general NFL game information, we create a feature matrix, $X$, with dimensionality $R \\times T \\times P$, where $R$ represents the number of pass rushes in the dataset at the *player-level*, $T$ represents the number of frames observed in the longest play in the data, and $P$ corresponds to the number of predictors$.^4$ Some predictors vary frame-to-frame (e.g., the pass rusher's $x$ and $y$), while others remain constant throughout the course of the play (e.g., $Quarter$). The outcome, $y$, is a boolean vector indicating a *PRSS* on the pass rush for player $i$ on passing play $s$ in game $g$.\n",
